 Extra Tips : commands for verification

To check flask is installed or not
pip show flask

Verify that the server is indeed running and accessible. You can use tools like telnet or curl to check if the server is accepting connections.
telnet ::1 5000
or
telnet 127.0.0.1 5000

For Windows: Open the Control Panel and navigate to "Programs" or "Programs and Features." Click on "Turn Windows features on or off." In the Windows Features dialog box, locate "Telnet Client" and enable it. Click "OK" to save the changes. The Telnet client will be installed.

How to know we are actually running the server before making post reaquest?
Run following command
Verify that the server is listening on the correct port. You can use various tools to check if the port is open and actively listening. For example, on Windows, you can use the `netstat` command with the `-a -n` flags to list all active network connections and listening ports. Look for an entry that corresponds to the expected port number of your server.
